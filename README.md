# Topological Portfolio Analysis
Final Project for Math 412/CS 434: _Topological Data Analysis_ taught by Dr. Greg Malen @ Duke University, Spring 2018. We used TDA to evaluate the performance of portfolios during the economic downturn of 2008 by detecting patterns in the topological changes. I wrote the __R__ scripts that conducted the sliding window analysis. Summary of paper and refactored, commented code forthcoming.
