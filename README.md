# Topological Portfolio Analysis
Final Project for Math 412/CS 434: _Topological Data Analysis_ taught by Dr. Greg Malen @ Duke University, Spring 2018. We used TDA to evaluate the performance of portfolios during the economic downturn of 2008 by detecting patterns in the topological changes. Summary of paper and refactored, commented code forthcoming. My contributions to this project consisted of:

* Programming the __R__ scripts that implemented the sliding window analysis technique that evaluated the topological changes of portfolios
* Latexing and editing the final paper
